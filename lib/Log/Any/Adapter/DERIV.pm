=head1 NAME

Log::Any::Adapter::DERIV - standardised logging to STDERR and JSON file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Applies some opinionated log handling rules for L<Log::Any>.

B<This is extremely invasive>. It does the following, affecting global state
in various ways:

=over 4

=item * applies UTF-8 encoding to STDERR

=item * writes to a C<.json.log> file named for the current process

=item * overrides the default L<Log::Any::Proxy> formatter to provide data as JSON

=item * when stringifying, may replace some problematic objects with simplified versions

=back

An example of the string-replacement approach would be the event loop in asynchronous code:
it's likely to have many components attached to it, and dumping that would effectively end up
dumping the entire tree of useful objects in the process. This is a planned future extension,
not currently implemented.

=head2 Why

This is provided as a CPAN module as an example for dealing with multiple outputs and
formatting. The existing L<Log::Any::Adapter> modules tend to cover one thing, and it's
not immediately obvious how to extend formatting, or send data to multiple logging mechanisms
at once.

Although the module may not be directly useful, it is hoped that other teams may find
parts of the code useful for their own logging requirements.

There is a public repository on Github, anyone is welcome to fork that and implement
their own version or make feature/bugfix suggestions if they seem generally useful:

# The obvious way to handle this might be to provide our own proxy class:

# where `use Log::Any` before the adapter is loaded means we end up with some classes having
# the default anyway.
# Rather than trying to deal with that, we just provide our own default:
